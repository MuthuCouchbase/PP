Easiest way I find is to:

    Right click project

    Debug as -> Maven build ...

    In the goals field put -Dmaven.surefire.debug test

    In the parameters put a new parameter called forkMode with a value of never

Set your breakpoints down and run this configuration and it should hit the breakpoint.
